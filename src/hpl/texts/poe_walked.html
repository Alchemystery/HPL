				<p>Eternal brood the shadows on this ground,
				<br>Dreaming of centuries that have gone before;
				<br>Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound,
				<br>Arched high above a hidden world of yore.
				<br>Round all the scene a light of memory plays,
				<br>And dead leaves whisper of departed days,
				<br>Longing for sights and sounds that are no more.
				<p>Lonely and sad, a specter glides along
				<br>Aisles where of old his living footsteps fell;
				<br>No common glance discerns him, though his song
				<br>Peals down through time with a mysterious spell.
				<br>Only the few who sorcery's secret know,
				<br>Espy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe.
