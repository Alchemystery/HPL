				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a grove-circled dwelling
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set close to a hill,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the branches are telling
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange legends of ill;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over timbers so old
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they breathe of the dead,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crawl the vines, green and cold,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By strange nourishment fed;
				<br>And no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank slimy bed.

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gardens are growing
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall blossoms and fair,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pallid bloom throwing
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfume on the air;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the afternoon sun
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with its shining red rays
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes the picture loom dun
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the curious gaze,
				<br>And above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless days.

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rank grasses are waving
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On terrace and lawn,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim memories savouring
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of things that have gone;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The stones of the walks
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are encrusted and wet,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a strange spirit stalks
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the red sun has set.
				<br>And the soul of the watcher is fill'd with faint pictures he fain would forget.

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in the hot Junetime
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood by that scene,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gold rays of noontime
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat bright on the green.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I shiver'd with cold,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groping feebly for light,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a picture unroll'd -
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my age-spanning sight
				<br>Saw the time I had been there before flash like fulgury out of the night.
