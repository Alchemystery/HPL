				<p>They cut it down, and where the pitch-black aisles
				<br>Of forest night had hid eternal things,
				<br>They scaled the sky with towers and marble piles
				<br>To make a city for their revellings.

				<p>White and amazing to the lands around
				<br>That wondrous wealth of domes and turrets rose;
				<br>Crystal and ivory, sublimely crowned
				<br>With pinnacles that bore unmelting snows.

				<p>And through its halls the pipe and sistrum rang,
				<br>While wine and riot brought their scarlet stains;
				<br>Never a voice of elder marvels sang,
				<br>Nor any eye called up the hills and plains.

				<p>Thus down the years, till on one purple night
				<br>A drunken minstrel in his careless verse
				<br>Spoke the vile words that should not see the light,
				<br>And stirred the shadows of an ancient curse.

				<p>Forests may fall, but not the dusk they shield;
				<br>So on the spot where that proud city stood,
				<br>The shuddering dawn no single stone revealed,
				<br>But fled the blackness of a primal wood.
