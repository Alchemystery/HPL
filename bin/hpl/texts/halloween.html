				<p>The steeples are white in the wild moonlight,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trees have a silver glare;
				<br>Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the harpies of upper air,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flutter and laugh and stare.
				<p>For the village dead to the moon outspread
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never shone in the sunset's gleam,
				<br>But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the rivers of madness stream
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the gulfs to a pit of dream.
				<p>A chill wind blows through the rows of sheaves
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meadows that shimmer pale,
				<br>And comes to twine where the headstones shine
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ghouls of the churchyard wail
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For harvests that fly and fail.
				<p>Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tore from the past its own
				<br>Can quicken this hour, when a spectral power
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreads sleep o'er the cosmic throne,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looses the vast unknown.
				<p>So here again stretch the vale and plain
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That moons long-forgotten saw,
				<br>And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprung out of the tomb's black maw
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shake all the world with awe.
				<p>And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugliness and the pest
				<br>Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall some day be with the rest,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brood with the shades unblest.
				<p>Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the leprous spires ascend;
				<br>For new and old alike in the fold
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of horror and death are penned,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the hounds of Time to rend.
