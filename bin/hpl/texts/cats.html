				<p>Babels of blocks to the high heavens towering
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flames of futility swirling below;
				<br>Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flowering,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow.
				<p>Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobwebs of cable to nameless things spun;
				<br>Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams of live foetor that rots in the sun.
				<p>Colour and splendour, disease and decaying,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrieking and ringing and crawling insane,
				<br>Rabbles exotic to stranger-gods praying,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jumbles of odour that stifle the brain.
				<p>Legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howling and lean in the glare of the moon,
				<br>Screaming the future with mouthings infernal,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yelling the Garden of Pluto's red rune.
				<p>Tall towers and pyramids ivy'd and crumbling,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bats that swoop low in the weed-cumber'd streets;
				<br>Bleak Arkham bridges o'er rivers whose rumbling
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joins with no voice as the thick horde retreats.
				<p>Belfries that buckle against the moon totter,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caverns whose mouths are by mosses effac'd,
				<br>And living to answer the wind and the water,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the lean cats that howl in the wastes.
