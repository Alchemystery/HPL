				<p>There is snow on the ground,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the valleys are cold,
				<br>And a midnight profound
				<br>&nbsp;Blackly squats o'er the wold;
				<br>But a light on the hilltops half-seen hints of
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;feastings unhallowed and old.
				<p>There is death in the clouds,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is fear in the night,
				<br>For the dead in their shrouds
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail the sun's turning flight.
				<br>And chant wild in the woods as they dance
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;round a Yule-altar fungous and white.
				<p>To no gale of Earth's kind
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sways the forest of oak,
				<br>Where the thick boughs entwined
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;By mad mistletoes choke,
				<br>For these pow'rs are the pow'rs of the dark,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;from the graves of the lost Druid-folk.
				<p>And mayst thou to such deeds
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be an abbot and priest,
				<br>Singing cannibal greeds
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;At each devil-wrought feast,
				<br>And to all the incredulous world
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;shewing dimly the sign of the beast.

<p>Originally a christmas poem sent to Farnsworth Wright, who surprised Lovecraft by publishing it as "Yule Horror."
