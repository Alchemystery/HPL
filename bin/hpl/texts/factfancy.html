				<p>How dull the wretch, whose philosophic mind
				<br>Disdains the pleasures of fantastic kind;
				<br>Whose prosy thoughts the joys of life exclude,
				<br>And wreck the solace of the poet's mood!
				<br>Young Zeno, practis'd in the Stoic's art,
				<br>Rejects the language of the glowing heart;
				<br>Dissolves sweet Nature to a mess of laws;
				<br>Condemns th' effect whilst looking for the cause;
				<br>Freezes poor Ovid in an iced review,
				<br>And sneers because his fables are untrue!
				<br>In search of hope the hopeful zealot goes,
				<br>But all the sadder tums, the more he knows!
				<br>Stay! Vandal sophist, whose deep lore would blast
				<br>The grateful legends of the storied past;
				<br>Whose tongue in censure flays th' embellish'd page,
				<br>And scorns the comforts of a dreary age:
				<br>Wouldst strip the foliage from the vital bough
				<br>Till all men grow as wisely dull as thou?
				<br>Happy the man whose fresh, untainted eye
				<br>Discerns a Pantheon in the spangled sky;
				<br>Finds sylphs and dryads in the waving trees,
				<br>And spies soft Notus in the southern breeze
				<br>For whom the stream a cheering carol sings,
				<br>While reedy music by the fountain rings;
				<br>To whom the waves a Nereid tale confide
				<br>Till friendly presence fills the rising tide.
				<br>Happy is he, who void of learning's woes,
				<br>Th' ethereal life of bodied Nature knows;
				<br>I scorn the sage that tells me it but seems,
				<br>And flout his gravity in sunlight dreams!
