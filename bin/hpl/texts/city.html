				<p>It was golden and splendid,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That City of light;
				<br>A vision suspended
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In deeps of the night;
				<br>A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white.

				<p>I remember the season
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It dawn'd on my gaze;
				<br>The mad time of unreason,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain-numbing days
				<br>When Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and craze.

				<p>More lovely than Zion
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It shone in the sky
				<br>When the beams of Orion
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beclouded my eye,
				<br>Bringing sleep that was filled with dim mem'ries of moments obscure and gone by.

				<p>Its mansions were stately,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With carvings made fair,
				<br>Each rising sedately
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;On terraces rare,
				<br>And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles blossoming there.

				<p>The avenues lur'd me
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With vistas sublime;
				<br>Tall arches assur'd me
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That once on a time
				<br>I had wander'd in rapture beneath them, and bask'd in the Halcyon clime.

				<p>On the plazas were standing
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A sculptur'd array;
				<br>Long bearded, commanding,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;rave men in their day-<br>But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face battered away.

				<p>In that city effulgent
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;No mortal I saw,
				<br>But my fancy, indulgent
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To memory's law,
				<br>Linger'd long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features with awe.

				<p>I fann'd the faint ember
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That glow'd in my mind,
				<br>And strove to remember
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The aeons behind;
				<br>To rove thro' infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin'd.

				<p>Then the horrible warning
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my soul sped
				<br>Like the ominous morning
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises in red,
				<br>And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead.
