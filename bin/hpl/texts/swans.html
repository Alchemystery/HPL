	<h3>by H. P. Lovecraft</h3>

<p>"Impromtu verse, or 'poetry' to order, is easy only when approached in the cooly <i>prosaic</i> sprit.  Given something to say, a <i>metrical mechanic</i> like myself can easily hammer the matter into technically correct verse, substituting formal poetic diction for real inspiration or thought.  For instance, I lately received a post-card bearing the picture of swans on a placid stream.  Desiring to reply in appropriate verse, I harked back to the classic myth of Phaethon and Cygnus, handling it as follows:

			<td>
				<p>With pensive grace, the melancholy Swan
				<br>Mourns o'er the tomb of luckless Phaethon;
				<br>On grassy banks the weeping poplars wave,
				<br>And guard with tender card the wat'ry grave.
				<br>Would that I might, should I too proudly claim
				<br>An Heav'nly parent, or a God-like fame;
				<br>When flown too high, and dash'd to depths below,
				<br>Receive such tribute as a Cygnus' woe!
				<br>The faithful bird, that dumbly floats along,
				<br>Sighs all the deeper for his want of song.
			</td>

<p>"This required about 10 minutes of composition."
