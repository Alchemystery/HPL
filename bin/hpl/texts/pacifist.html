				<p>We are the valiant Knights of Peace
				<br>Who prattle for the Right:
				<br>Our banner is of snowy fleece,
				<br>Inscrib'd: "TOO PROUD TO FIGHT!"
				<p>By sweet Chautauqua's flow'ry banks
				<br>We love to sing and play,
				<br>But should we spy a foeman's ranks!
				<br>We'd proudly run away!
				<p>When Prussian fury sweeps the main
				<br>Our freedom to deny;
				<br>Of tyrant laws we ne'er complain;
				<br>But gladsomely comply!
				<p>We do not fear the submarines
				<br>That plough the troubled foam;
				<br>We scorn the ugly old machines -
				<br>And safely stay at home!
				<p>They say our country's close to war
				<br>And soon must man the guns;
				<br>But we see naught to struggle for -
				<br>We love the gentle Huns!
				<p>What though their hireling Greaser bands
				<br>Invade our southern plains?
				<br>We well can spare those boist'rous lands,
				<br>Content with what remains!
				<p>Our fathers were both rude and bold,
				<br>And would not live like brothers;
				<br>But we are of a finer mould -
				<br>We're much more like our mothers!
