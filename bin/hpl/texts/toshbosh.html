				<p>Ah, Passion, like a voice-that buds!
				<br>With many thorns...that sharply stick:
				<br>Recalls to me the longing of our bloods...
				<br>And-makes my wearied heart requick! ...
				<h3 align="center">Arcadia</h3>
				<p align="center"><i>by Head Balledup</i>
				<p>O give me the life of the Village,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninhibited, free, and sweet.
				<br>The place where the arts all flourish,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grove Court and Christopher Street.
				<p>I am sick of the old conventions,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And critics who will not praise,
				<br>So sing ho for the open spaces,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And aesthetes with kindly ways.
				<p>Here every bard is a genius,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And artists are Raphaels,
				<br>And above the roofs of Patchin Place
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muse of Talent dwells.
